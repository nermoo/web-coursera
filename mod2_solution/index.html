        <h2 id="chicken">Chicken</h2>
        <p>This is a Filipino chicken dish flavored with ginger and coconut milk. Each family has their own version. This is my mother's version. It's a rich dish that makes your kitchen smell so wonderful! Once my family smells the ginger frying and coconut milk simmering, they can't wait for it to be done so they can dig in! I salt it liberally as the coconut milk tends to hide the salt flavor.

        <p>Place a piece of fish or shrimp in your hand and smear it lightly with wasabi paste if desired. Grab 1 to 2 tablespoons of rice and roll it into a small nugget in your hand. Place the rice ball on top of the fish or shrimp, squeezing gently to make it adhere. Set aside while you assemble the remaining pieces of fish and shrimp.</p>
